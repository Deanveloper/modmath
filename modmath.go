// A package that does modular arithmetic.
//
// Doesn't use a single % operator or any math library functions.
// This is more for experience than for actual use. There is also a variation of this for big integers,
// which can be found in the bigmod package (github.com/deanveloper/modmath/bigmod)
package modmath
