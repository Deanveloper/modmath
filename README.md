-----
A Go API to solve Modular Arithmetic Problems. [GoDoc]

The `edu` folder uses inefficient ways to solve the problems, and exists mostly for educational purposes.
I would not use this if I were you. A version that actually uses things such as built-in modulus operators, power
functions, etc. will be made available when I have time.
